## About myself:
 I figure out one thing that i love programming. Because i loved solving tasks. I took participant in chemistry olympiad in school. It was like battle of wits between pupils. I was good in it. Second degree diploma on republic stage is confirmation of this. Then there was study in BSU (Chemistry faculty) and work in Belaruskaliy.

 I realized that I dont want to work there because it was brainless job. I quit my job and decided to learn JavaScript. I will do my best to learn it and keep learning.
